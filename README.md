# RAG Q-A System

Built a Q&A system using LangChain with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to process queries across Arxiv, Wikipedia, and PDFs. Integrated data retrieval and generative AI to deliver concise, accurate responses.

**Input**:

User Queries: The system accepts natural language input from users in the form of questions or queries.

Document Sources: The system processes data from multiple knowledge sources, including:

Arxiv research papers (scientific articles and research documents)

Wikipedia (encyclopedic articles and summaries)

PDF documents (such as research papers, reports, or documentation)

**Processing Pipeline:**

**Data Retrieval:**

LangChain Framework: Utilized LangChain to build the pipeline, enabling integration between multiple data sources and large language models (LLMs).
Vector Store Indexing: Documents from Arxiv, Wikipedia, and PDFs are embedded into a vector space using embedding models (e.g., OpenAI or Hugging Face embeddings). This step allows for efficient similarity-based search.

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):
When a query is made, relevant chunks of text are retrieved using similarity search from the indexed documents.
Retrieval is performed based on the semantic similarity of the query to the documents, ensuring only the most relevant information is selected.

Generative AI (LLM Integration):
The retrieved documents are passed to a large language model (e.g., OpenAI GPT or other models) to generate a concise and coherent response.
The LLM uses the context provided by the retrieved data to generate an accurate, context-aware answer that directly addresses the user's query.
LangChainâ€™s prompt engineering ensures that the LLM processes the context effectively to avoid hallucinations and provide factually correct responses.

**Output:**

Concise, Accurate Answers: The system delivers a well-formed response based on the combined knowledge from all the document sources.

Contextual Insights: The generated response is augmented with data from the retrieved documents, allowing users to get both concise answers and additional contextual insights.

Traceable Source Material: Optionally, the system can provide references or snippets of the original documents from which the information was drawn, ensuring transparency and allowing users to verify the data.

**Key Technologies:**

LangChain: For orchestrating the retrieval and generation process, as well as integrating multiple tools for data retrieval, indexing, and prompt handling.

RAG: The Retrieval-Augmented Generation model enables more relevant and accurate responses by combining document retrieval with generative AI.

Vector Databases: Used for indexing document embeddings and efficiently searching for relevant context to feed into the LLM.

Large Language Models (LLMs): For generating human-like responses based on the query and retrieved data.
